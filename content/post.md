Here's thing.

I met a nice guy. He's really nice and kind to me. Even though we're only chatting online, his words melt my heart. How lucky I am!

We have made a deal to have dinner before those guys who want to hang out with you through voice call right now. But the truth is that you'd like to go out with those guys, and I'm just an idiot. This is a lie, and I don't like people who break promises.

I will only state the facts and not put myself in the shoes of the other party to betray the other party and vice versa. But what happened today really gave me chills, everyone is saying you didn't communicate ahead of time, I don't know what to say, we don't have a way to cover it. Even though my response was "This is my problem, I just want to know how to solve the problem, give a conclusion and learn a lesson". And there was only one person who quietly helped me in this process by giving me advice and getting to the final conclusion. Maybe that's the people, quite a good lesson.

I was too busy with work and spent a few weeks finally reading the two books "The Road Ahead" by Ruan Yifeng and "Survivors of the Future World". It was very rewarding and worth reading again, and I will keep reading in the future.

Speaking of work, it consumed my passion for technology. Commercial companies want us to create value and profits, and senior leaders don't care about real technology. All they want is promotion and the rights that come with it. And I just want to use technology to solve real-world problems to help others live better lives.

Everything goes fast these days. I've been through so much. I met someone, happy or painful. I worked, and the work fucked me up. I was stuck in there and I couldn't run out, stuck in my work and my feelings. It's so real I can feel, I write something down for myself to touch my inner world so closely, I call it memory.

Although I know that many things are only fleeting, I am still very grateful and happy to hear such an answer from Zhang Chu, then I'm here is worth it.

Even though I am on personal leave now, I am a free man. One day before, I went to my leader's office and I told him "Bad news.", he immediately guessed what I am meaning, and he said "Do you want to leave?", I nod. He then said "Did you just leave your brother here alone? You just played me!", I smiled bitterly. In fact, I don't want to do that, but I can't help it. Later, he gave me an idea, that is let me take a month off first, and then decide, I agreed. Actually, I am very happy to meet him, but he told everyone that I was leaving, yes, EVERYONE! Fine, I do really like him, that's all.

Finally, I talked to my boss what I thought about quit my job, he also agreed with what I've decided, but we don't name the date, maybe I should talk with him again in the next week.


## 2022-06-01

Again and again, those people just don't understand what they are doing and what they are facing. Tired, good luck for you guys!


## 2022-05-30

What can you do without your current job?


## 2022-05-19

What I'm looking for? What am I doing here for now? I cannot figure it out, and I've been so tired. I just want to go somewhere where I can enjoy quiet and have some time to think.

Can you hear me?


## 2022-05-01

You spent all my patience, I don't beg you know.


## 2022-04-30

Conflicts, you and I, full of conflicts. We call out, untrust each other. Even though I love you so much, I cannot talking with you peaceful, and you too. I'm trying to say this is the last time, I will get rid of this bad memory, and say goodbye for you, and I don't want to repair this breaking relationship anymore, never again!


## 2022-03-19

It breaks my heart that he said something like that even though I talked to him so much. Keeping distance and silence may be a good idea, good luck for you.


## 2022-02-20

If I cannot leave here, justice can never be served. Those people who have narrow picture will die for their ignorant. Everything will be clam down, but I will be remembered you biatches, have fun tonight.

- I just can't forgive myself cause of self-demanding, for everything.
- I love you and I told you, don't hide your feeling. If you love me, please tell me.
- You just like a child who wants to eat everything, unrestrained, overwhelmed by profit, that's a shame.

This is a protracted war, for myself, for our future.

It's too bad for now, I'm feeling very angry cause of those people who want me to leave but don't hand over my work, just like L.K., he's really a selfish asshole, I cannot figure out how these people live in this world without any mercy? Damn it, I hope god bless you!


## 2021-07-16

Today we went to see our colleague, something happened to him. When we talked with his mother, I was very sad, because some bad things happened before on someone, and that thing float on my brain on that moment, it's too darkness! Hope god bless him, and me.
