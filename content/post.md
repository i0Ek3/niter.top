What I'm looking for? What am I doing here for now? I cannot figure it out, and I've been so tired. I just want to go somewhere where I can enjoy quiet and have some time to think.

Can you hear me?

Conflicts, you and I, full of conflicts. We call out, untrust each other. Even though I like you so much, I cannot talking with you peaceful, and you too. I'm trying to say this is the last time, I will get rid of this bad memory, and say goodbye for you, and I don't want to repair this stuff anymore, never again!

It breaks my heart that he said something like that even though I talked to him so much. Keeping distance and silence may be a good idea, good luck for you.

- I just can't forgive myself cause of self-demanding, for everything.
- I love you and I told you, don't hide your feeling. If you love me, please tell me.
- You just like a child who wants to eat everything, unrestrained, overwhelmed by profit, that's shame.

Today we went to see our colleague. Something happened to him. When we talked with his mother, I was very sad, because some bad things happened before on someone, and that thing float on my brain on that moment, it's too dark! God bless him and me.
