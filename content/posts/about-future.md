Last Friday, November 22nd, he came to see me. Although I was very busy and had exams coming up, I was still really happy. It had been a long time since I last saw him, and I truly missed him.

For me, there are always so many conflicting emotions I can't control when it comes to him, but I try my best to suppress them. I admit, I really like him. Even though sometimes I say things in anger, those words are quickly overturned. I've shared all my thoughts with him, honestly and openly, I pour everything out to him.

I told him that when he's not around, I always miss him so much, I want to fly to be by his side right away. Sometimes I even worry this might be the last time I see him.

I told him that if my future life could have him by my side, I'd be willing to settle here or move to his city to live.

I told him that it doesn't matter where we go to see the sights, as long as I can have you with me.

I told him I want to be with him forever, and my feelings for him are always so strong, I also want to have sex with him.

However, he seemed to think I was just talking nonsense, saying that I was being childish and unrealistic. I asked him if there was any chance for us to be together, because I really don't want to lose him. But then again, what does that even mean?

I kissed him secretly, but he pulled away. I touched him, and he resisted. I told him I wanted to hold him to sleep, but he refused. I wanted to hug him, and he didn't want that either. But despite all of this, he is still the one I am closest to.

I told him that maybe one day I really would leave here, move to another country. He said that's not possible, and told me shouldn't think about that. When I asked why, he couldn't give me a real reason, just that it wasn't realistic. I asked, "Is it that you don't want me to leave?" He said, "Yes."

I don't want to leave either, but there are too many things I can't control. I know deep down that no matter how obsessed I am with him, even willing to make sacrifices for him, in the end, I still won't have him. If he gets married, I think our intimate relationship will come to an abrupt end.

Unlike before, with every previous parting, I would feel extremely reluctant, even secretly shedding tears. But this time, I felt like a cold, emotionless machine, with no waves in my heart.

At the time of parting, he said, "All the decisions are in your hands." I said, "Take my heart with you."

The world outside may not be as wonderful as I imagined. Without him, where should I go in life?
