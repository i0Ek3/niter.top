Alright, this article just write for myself to record how I improve my English level.

This action begins with Cory Noziglia(he is a professional music producer, you can find him on [Bilibili](https://space.bilibili.com/1573656090)). Someday I watched his [video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1QB4y1y7iW?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0) on Bilibili, I'm confused how did he pick a song to perform, so I leave a message on the comment area, and then he responds my question about that, after then we add WeChat and we talk everyday.

But, my English is not good enough, and I think I need to improve it right now. At the same time, I find the Bob([Bob the Canadian](https://www.youtube.com/c/LearnEnglishwithBobtheCanadian)) on YouTube, his teaching video is very good, so I watched a lot, I can understand most of his videos.

Today, I found this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL8KR97zHVg), and I want to share with you guys here, if you want to improve your English level, please do follow steps everyday.

- **Reading**: You can read news, books and other stuff you like, twice at least.

- **Listening**: You can listen news, music, TV shows and other stuff you like, once at least.

- **Writing**: Write English on your blog or Twitter/Instagram/Facebook/Medium/Reddit everyday, and use tools to check your English grammar.

- **Speaking**: Speak to yourself over and over again, record it and listen it to correct your pronunciation.

- **Build Your Vocabulary**: Needless to say, this part needs to be recited every day.

- **Have a Real English Conversation**: For Chinese, this part is hard. But, there also is a way to get a real conversation on some English learning website, you can find it on the Internet.

After these 6 steps everyday, I think you'll find the differences. At the same time, you'd better know it's very important to use English to think instead of your original language.

But how could we use English to think? Please do follow steps everyday.

- **Read and Listen at the Same Time**: Because you have no free time to translate what you are seeing or hearing.
- **Listen Longer Audio/Video**: Longer audio or video need to take long time to process, you're tired to translate.
- **Describe What You Are Seeing**: Describe the surrounding stuff with the word you know instead of you don't know.
- **Shadowing the Video You Like**: Shadowing helps to practice your sense of language.
- **Visualization What You Are Seeing**: Image, draw or find the picture what you are seeing to strength memory.
- **Only Use English Dictionary**: This is a good habit to use only English dictionary, for example Webster.
- **Repetition What You Are Hearing**: Practice makes perfect.

After practicing this way for a few months, you will feel your progress. The important thing is that you need to stick with it, and use what you learned.
