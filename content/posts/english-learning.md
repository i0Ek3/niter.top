Alright, this article just write for myself to record how I improve my English.

This action begins with Cory Noziglia(he is a professional music producer, you can find him on [Bilibili](https://space.bilibili.com/1573656090)). Someday I watched his [video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1QB4y1y7iW?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0) on Bilibili, I'm confused how he pick a song to perform, so I leave my message on the comment area, and then he responds my question about that, after then we add WeChat and we talk everyday.

But, my English is not good enough, and I think I need to improve it right now. At the same time, I find the Bob([Bob the Canadian](https://www.youtube.com/c/LearnEnglishwithBobtheCanadian)) on YouTube, his teaching video is very good, so I watched a lot, I can understand most of his videos.

Today, I found this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL8KR97zHVg), and I want to share with you guys here, if you want to improve your English level, please do follow steps everyday.

## 1. Reading

You can read news, books and other stuff you like, twice at least.

## 2. Listening

You can listen news, music, TV shows and other stuff you like, once at least.

## 3. Writing

Write English on your blog or Twitter/Instagram/Facebook/Medium/Reddit everyday, and use tools to check your English grammar.

## 4. Speaking

Speak to yourself over and over again, record it and listen it to correct your pronunciation.

## 5. Build Your Vocabulary

Needless to say, this part needs to be recited every day.

## 6. Have a Real English Conversation

For Chinese, this part is hard. But, there also is a way to get a real conversation on some English learning website, you can find it on the Internet.



After these 6 steps everyday, I think you'll find the changes.
