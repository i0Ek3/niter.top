## Record

Some days ago, my blog on Netlify went offline cause of I changed it's name servers to the original one(Namesilo). So I decide to record what should I do after my blog offline. Here's thing:

First, I find some solutions which is available in surface:

- buy a new domain(or register a free one on Freenom) to bind your VPS and restore my blog
- [WIP] deploy your site on your VPS instead of Netlify
- configure external DNS for Netlify, ref [here](https://docs.netlify.com/domains-https/custom-domains/configure-external-dns/)(add A record with IP 75.2.60.5)
- use Nginx to reverse proxy
- find the other solution(like hyber name servers, it seems not work well)

Secondly, I just tried the third one and I got nothing. 

Today, I want to try to deploy my blog on my VPS and to look what happend. And now, you can visit my blog again.
