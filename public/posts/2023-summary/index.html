        <p>In the last days of the end of 2022, I joined my current company and have been here ever since.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been through a lot in the past year, the good aspects and the bad ones are countless.</p>
<p>From the beginning of the cloud to know, but also some do not know to confusion and anxiety to the total difference between so little meaning, in the process I seem to have learned to reconcile with themselves, but also stubbornly do not admit defeat, and always self-doubt and then slowly feel no matter what, this process can be described as sweet and sour, both bitter and spicy, pain and pleasure.</p>
<p>In this process, in addition to changes in my personal state of mind, I have also learned a lot, whether it is communication with others or technical ability to improve, but still almost mean.</p>
<p>Some people say that I don&rsquo;t have the same kind of goal I used to have. That&rsquo;s really true! I don&rsquo;t know when, I have forgotten my original intention, the original intention of coming here, and before I came here is a completely different mentality, and I care more about the kind of feeling I had before I came here. After I came here, everything changed so differently, and it seemed to make sense.</p>
<p>The good thing is that my perception has changed since I came here, and my perception of myself has become clearer than before, knowing what I can and can&rsquo;t do, and I&rsquo;ve accomplished a few of the goals I set for myself before I came here. I have stayed for a whole year, explored my boundaries, accumulated some savings and learned some skills.</p>
<p>Of course there are some bad points, here is really very busy, a lot of overtime, a lot of time is not really meaningful, coworkers get along with the communication is always strange, but there are some coworkers get along with or very happy.</p>
<p>Of course the bad points have something to do with personalities. Personally, I am insecure, so I won&rsquo;t trust others easily, my inner defense is very high, so high that even if others trust me, I won&rsquo;t trust them completely. I can&rsquo;t help it, that&rsquo;s just me, not to mention that everyone here is a hired gun, and everyone flaunts their own self-interests, each with their own agenda.</p>
<p>However, one thing that will never change is that I will never stop learning and will never stop my determination to keep searching for answers. One thing I have learned here is that it is a gain to be around happy people and good people who can learn. These points have helped me in my life as well.</p>
<p>As for afterward, it&rsquo;s still important to have a stronger belief and a sense of forward planning, and to keep your eyes and ears open. Put your free time to use and stop wasting time on people and things that don&rsquo;t work. Learning is to accumulate, do not always think of explosive growth. As for whether or not from continuing things this direction is no longer important, some of the things learned here can be applied to other directions, to be able to output both horizontally and vertically, and to do something more composite, rather than just looking at the current.</p>
<p>2024, keep up the good work. As for refined goals, I&rsquo;m self-calculating in my mind.</p>
