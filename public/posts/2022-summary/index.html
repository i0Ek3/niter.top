        <p>Four months ago, after thinking about it over and over again, I quit my job, the reason I quit that job can find it on my GitHub, I won&rsquo;t go into details here, but I&rsquo;ll tell you something about it after I quit that job. Not funny, just some words.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve taken many detours, I&rsquo;ve doubted myself many times, and I&rsquo;ve learned a lot from my past, but I&rsquo;m still here, cause I never give up. I hope you&rsquo;re all too.</p>
<p>I assume that I will be very busy in the next few weeks, so I took the time to write this article, which can be regarded as a sentence for this year.</p>
<h2 id="after-this">

</h2>
<p>After I quit my job, I make some plans, some good, some not. I give myself some time to prepare for the interview and to find a job, but there is always a barrier stand front of me. Well, I&rsquo;ll kick it off while I have a good mood, otherwise, I let it be. I don&rsquo;t feel guilty and have no honor either, just peaceful.</p>
<p>During these four months, I learned, I practiced, I doubted myself every day, but I never give it up, I just walk through my plan, because I really don&rsquo;t know what will happen next, I only have a plan. Fortunately, I got a job. Of course, getting this job is not easy for me, I spent so much time on it, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter, I fight for it then we got good news.</p>
<p>Sometimes, if you feel so tired, you just need to slow down and take a breath, don&rsquo;t push yourself so much, you have your fate on your hand, and that&rsquo;s why I still make sense. You can listen to so many peoples&rsquo; voices, but you also need the capability to filter those bad voices, they only drag you down.</p>
<p>Well, after all of this, you may see something clearly more than ever, there is no doubt.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s no matter what things you&rsquo;ve done before if someone is totally back behind you, that would be awesome. But you&rsquo;ll find that everything just looks wired because those people don&rsquo;t really hope you&rsquo;re good, they only worked on the surface, and they really don&rsquo;t fucking care about you. So, the point is you shouldn&rsquo;t piss yourself off there, just move your butt and make your backup work.</p>
<p>You always need a plan or some plans, the plan makes you line up all the time even if you look fall down right now, but it&rsquo;s just like a lighthouse to guide you where you should go. Also, feedback is like a train track, which tells you to follow it up.</p>
<p>To be honest, after this, you have so much time to think about what you like and how to make money(actually I make some money before that, even though it looks not good enough), to feel, to enjoy the life you live on. Also, you have to make some decisions even though you don&rsquo;t like them, you can&rsquo;t change anything. You know, all of these decisions may need more time to take effect, so you need to wait a couple of days or months, otherwise, you&rsquo;ll feel so lonely. If you are not very self-disciplined, the days without restraint may lead you to indulgence.</p>
<p>Do you really like it? Especially you need to say goodbye to those guys you&rsquo;re familiar with before, say goodbye to the house where you lived before. You need to take risks with all of this, but you&rsquo;re a tough guy, ain&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>Finally, you still make that decision to embrace a strange city but familiar, you know, you lived there before.</p>

<p>From the beginning of 2022, I struggled every day, I asked myself where my passion live. I got some offers, and then I reject them. I interviewed some companies, and they reject me over and over again. Everything was like a dead loop, I&rsquo;m the ant in there, so tiny, so hopeless. But you shouldn&rsquo;t give up, keep it going and learning every day, over and over again, until there appears a chance, then grab it, and then you&rsquo;ll be made it happen.</p>
<p>People talk about me in private, for nothing, for entertainment, for caring, they just talked. Saying goodbye seems superfluous, people only talk about things they care about, or they don&rsquo;t really care about. That doesn&rsquo;t matter, I love you all to make me grow.</p>
<p>Finally, I am no longer alone in the 60-square-meter room, and the honor of loneliness is shared by me and the garlic sprouts I have raised in the cup in the last few days.</p>
<p>You know what, I don&rsquo;t give a shit, that&rsquo;s my life, I&rsquo;m the boss.</p>

<p>I feel happy, fearful, and excited.</p>
<p>First thing, you move to Beijing, again. Before that, I can&rsquo;t imagine I will back there again, but I really did it. Also, the COVID virus waiting for you, maybe they wanna make friends with you. Oh, welcome~ But, the truth is that I hope the COVID virus can be gone. Secondly, it&rsquo;s worth celebrating that you made a big step from the past, you are so brave, you deserve it. Last, the improvement of technology is my pursuit all the time, and I hope that I can grow rapidly in the new environment.</p>
<p>Do you have anything else to look forward to here? Maybe, I should feel this city and look at its every move, to enjoy this sky again. After all, this is whole new life, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Oh, as an IT guy, I hope you guys are debt free, me too.</p>

<p>There are so many uncertain events here, we know nothing about these events, but we can use our intelligence and past experiences to evaluate them and make a decision that we think is right in our current mind. Even though it doesn&rsquo;t look smart, still works.</p>
<p>Thus, if you can move steps quickly, just move, if not, just enjoy every current moment.</p>

<p>There is a poem that I like it very much, so I translated it and shared it with you, hope you guys like it so.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>New York time is three hours ahead of California time, but California time isn&rsquo;t slowing down.</p>
<p>Someone graduated at 22, but waited five years to find a good job!</p>
<p>Someone became a CEO at 25, then he died at the age of 50.</p>
<p>There are also people who become CEOs as late as 50 years old, then live to be 90 years old.</p>
<p>Someone is still single, there are also people who are married.</p>
<p>Obama retired at 55, Trump didn&rsquo;t become president until he was 70.</p>
<p>Everyone in the world has their own development time zone.</p>
<p>Some people around you seem to walk ahead of you, there are also people who appear to be walking behind you.</p>
<p>But in fact, everyone has their own pace in their own time zone.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be jealous or laugh at them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all in their own time zone, and so are you!</p>
<p>Life is about waiting for the right moment to act.</p>
<p>So, take it easy.</p>
<p>You are not behind.</p>
<p>You are not ahead.</p>
<p>In your own time zone that fate has arranged for you, everything is on time.</p>
